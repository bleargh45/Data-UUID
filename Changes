1.148 Thu Nov 16 10:21 2006
  - Debian has chosen to distribute their own Data::UUID, which has a different
    interface and breaks other modules.  They also use a grossly-inflated
    version number, which means that this version number must be inflated to
    allow modules to rely on the CPAN Data::UUID properly.

    Tests added to EXPLICITLY assert the one known difference between genuine
    Data::UUID and Debian's ersatz version in libossp-uuid-perl.

    Thanks to ADAMK for bringing this to my attention.
