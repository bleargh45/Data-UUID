Data::UUID
=================

Data::UUID - Perl extension for generating Globally/Universally 
	     Unique Identifiers (GUIDs/UUIDs).

This module provides a framework for generating UUIDs (Universally Unique
Identifiers, also known as GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers). A UUID is
128 bits long, and is guaranteed to be different from all other UUIDs/GUIDs
generated until 3400 A.D. UUIDs were originally used in the Network Computing 
System (NCS) and later in the Open Software Foundation's (OSF) Distributed 
Computing Environment. Currently many different technologies rely on UUIDs to
provide unique identity for various software components, Microsoft COM/DCOM
for instance, uses GUIDs very extensively to uniquely identify classes, 
applications and components across network-connected systems.
